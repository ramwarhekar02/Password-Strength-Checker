# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple web-based password strength checker built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It dynamically evaluates the strength of a password based on certain criteria and provides visual feedback through a strength bar.

## Features

- **Interactive Password Input**: Users can enter a password, and the strength of the password is evaluated as they type.
- **Strength Indicator**: A strength bar visually represents whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.
- **Instant Feedback**: The feedback is updated in real time based on the complexity of the password.

## Password Strength Criteria

The strength of the password is evaluated using the following criteria:
1. **Weak**: If the password is less than 6 characters long or contains only lowercase letters.
2. **Medium**: If the password includes both lowercase and uppercase letters and is longer than 6 characters.
3. **Strong**: If the password contains a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters, and is longer than 8 characters.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and the strength bar.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the logic for evaluating the password strength and updating the user interface.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Start typing a password in the input field, and observe how the strength bar and the accompanying text change based on the complexity of the password.

## Code Overview

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the password checker.
- `style.css`: Styles the input field, strength bar, and the overall layout.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic that evaluates the password strength.

## Installation

No additional installation is required. Simply clone the repository or download the project files and open the `index.html` in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- Adding more complex rules for password strength evaluation, such as checking for common password patterns.
- Displaying suggestions for improving weak passwords.
- Providing support for password visibility toggle.
